### rules
The task is to match people with secret scientists they presented.
You'll see two people from the lab on the left
and two rows of clues that look like moon surface.
You reveal clues by clicking on them (first click reveals a photo,
second reveals the name of the secret scientist),
the more clues you reveal the less points you get.
To make a choice you either keep the order as is
or click on the ðŸ”„ button (you can change your mind and click again
but some points will be subtracted). When you're ready click "submit",
look at all the clues revealed (for educational purposes)
and wait for the next round.
